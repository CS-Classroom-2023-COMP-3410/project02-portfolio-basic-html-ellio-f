This assignment made me realize that I don't like making things without a clear expectation of what it's going to turn out as. 
With so much creative power, I found myself in decision paralysis on what to do worrying it wouldn't be good enough.
Ultimately I had to take the jump and start. There were a lot of tedious tasks and since each page is a different file, it was 
annoying when I decided to change certain parts of the overall format of the website since I had to do it on each page. Doing it 
over and over again helped hammer in exactly how everything had to be typed and it's probably for the best I had such a hard time 
making decisions and redid everything a few different times. Hope you like it :)

Also I hope you enjoy the pop culture references lol
